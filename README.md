This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict player ratings in FIFA 22. Using player attributes as input features, we trained and evaluated multiple regression models to estimate the "Overall" rating of each player.

The models implemented include:

Linear Regression – for establishing a baseline and interpreting feature relationships.

Random Forest Regressor – to capture non-linear patterns and feature interactions.

Gradient Boosting Regressor – for high-accuracy predictions through sequential learning.

Performance was assessed using standard metrics such as MAE and RMSE.
